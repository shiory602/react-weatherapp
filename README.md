Objective: (a) Create a Weather App with HTML,CSS and React. You can use the same app that
we did in the previous course or create a new one if you want this.
1. Create a UI for a Weather App (webSite).
2. Use the Fetch API to fetch the data from Open Weather API
(https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in)
3. Your app must show Vancouver's weather as default, but the user can be able to search
for the weather of another city. (To show Vancouver's weather as default you can use
the `componentDidMout()` to fetch the data before the user searches for a new city.

4. If the city is not found, a pop up should appear informing the user that it was not found.
5. The information that the app should show is Name of the city, currently weather, Feel
Like, etc.
6. Please create at least 2 components for your app. You can decide if your component
should be a function component or class component.
7. Use Context API for sharing data(props) between components.
